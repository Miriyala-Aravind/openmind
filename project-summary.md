https://github.com/jaseg/OpenMind-micro
The OpenMind project aims to create easy-to-use high-quality open source EEG boards which may e.g. be used in conjunction with an Arduino to build a OpenSource EEG. We use integrated analog frontends with 24 bit precision for data acquisition.

What can I do?
--------------
Currently, we urgently need YOU to build and test the hardware and help write the host software to visualize and analyze the data.

How can I join?
---------------
Fork me on github and/or drop me a mail. Any help is welcome!
